# In-Contex-Learning_final_project

This project is about the in context learning capacity of large language model on the periodic function like sin(Wx + b).We want to figure out how to whether the modern architectrue can learn the latent function in our input (x1, f(x1), x2, f(x2) ,...,xn, f(xn)) without providing any labels.
